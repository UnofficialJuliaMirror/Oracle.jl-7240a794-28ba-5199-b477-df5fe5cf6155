# Oracle.jl

This package provides a driver to access Oracle databases using the Julia language,
based on [odpi](https://github.com/oracle/odpi) bindings.

## Development Notice

This package is under development.

It's planned to be a functional package by the end of January 2019.

## Instant Client installation

* [Download](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/database-technologies/instant-client/downloads/index.html) instant client.

* Unzip and add `instantclient` folder to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH:

```
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path-to-folder/instantclient_XX_Y:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

## ODPI-C Naming Conventions

All enums, constants and structs in ODPI-C library use the prefix `DPI` or `dpi`.

In *Oracle.jl*, the Julia implementation of these elements use the prefix `ORA` or `Ora`.

Examples:

* The ODPI-C constant `DPI_MODE_AUTH_SYSDBA` becomes `ORA_MODE_AUTH_SYSDBA` in Julia.

* The ODPI-C enum `dpiAuthMode` becomes `OraAuthMode` in Julia.

* The ODPI-C struct `dpiTimestamp` becomes `OraTimestamp` in Julia.

All julia structs with prefix `Ora` are raw wrappers around ODPC-C structs and may contain unsafe attributes.

Safe equivalent Julia structs drop the `Ora` prefix.

ODPI-C *function wrappers* have their name preserved, as in `dpiContext_create`.
